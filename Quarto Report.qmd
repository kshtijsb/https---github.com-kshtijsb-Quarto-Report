# **1. Trend of 'Proportion of health care facilities with no sanitation service' over the years for Afghanistan**

sanitation_data = df_indicator_1[df_indicator_1['indicator'] == indicator_of_interest]

avg_sanitation_by_country = sanitation_data.groupby('country')['obs_value'].mean()

                f'{indicator_of_interest} in Top 10 Countries Over the Years',
                'Year', 'Observation Value', color='blue', hue='country')

```
"**Let's begin with a fundamental issue:** access to basic sanitation in health care facilities.  Our initial visualization is on top 10 Countries. It presents the trend of 'Proportion of health care facilities with no sanitation service' over time.  What we see is how country like Tanzania is improving year by year."

## 2. Bar Chart: Compare 'Proportion of health care facilities with no sanitation service' across different countries in the latest available year



```{python}
latest_year = df_indicator_1['year'].max()
latest_sanitation = df_indicator_1[(df_indicator_1['year'] == latest_year) & (df_indicator_1['indicator'] == indicator_of_interest)]
top_n = 20
top_countries_sanitation = latest_sanitation.nlargest(top_n, 'obs_value')
plot_bar_chart(top_countries_sanitation, 'country', 'obs_value',
                    f'{indicator_of_interest} in {latest_year} (Top {top_n} Countries)',
                    'Country', 'Observation Value')

```

"To put Afghanistan into perspective, we broaden our view. This bar chart compares the 'Proportion of health care facilities with no sanitation service' for a number of countries for the latest available year. This visualization shows that the sanitation crisis is not specific to Afghanistan; it's a global problem that needs immediate action."


## 3. Line Charts: Trends of 'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)' and 'Life expectancy at birth, total (years)' over the years for Afghanistan



```{python}
afg_metadata = df_metadata[df_metadata['country'] == 'Afghanistan']
plot_line_chart(afg_metadata, 'year', 'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)',
                    'GDP per capita in Afghanistan Over the Years',
                    'Year', 'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)', color='green')
plot_line_chart(afg_metadata, 'year', 'Life expectancy at birth, total (years)',
                    'Life Expectancy at Birth in Afghanistan Over the Years',
                    'Year', 'Life expectancy at birth, total (years)', color='red')

```

"Now, let's zoom back in to Afghanistan and examine the broader context of development. These two line graphs tell a story about the interplay between economic factors and health outcomes. The first graph tracks 'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)' over time, and the second graph plots 'Life expectancy at birth, total (years)' over the same period. What do we observe? How Afagnistan having a good GDP Per Capita in 2013 had good Life Expectancy and in the later years the GDP Per Capita had a significant fall but the Life Expentacy was somewhat same. This comparison enables us to observe the complex relationship between a nation's wealth and the health of its people. It's not always a straightforward relationship."

## 4. Line chart of **\'*FEMALE*'\ ** and **\'*MALE*'\ ** deaths aged 15-24 in India



```{python}
india_deaths = df_indicator_2[(df_indicator_2['country'] == 'India') & (df_indicator_2['indicator'] == 'Deaths aged 15 to 24')]
plot_line_chart(india_deaths, 'year', 'obs_value', 'Deaths Aged 15-24 in India (1990-2020)',
                    'Year', 'Number of Deaths', hue='sex')

```

"Now we turn to India as we consider the next visualization. The line chart indicates 'FEMALE' vs. **'MALE'** deaths at **15-24** years. This is the age range, the transition to adulthood. What does this tell us about gender differentials in mortality? This shows us how goverment of India invested in health care sector, due to which the death count has been significantly gone down in both male and female. These findings raise very significant questions about social factors, access to resources, and specific risks faced by young women and men in initial years for India." 


## 5. Scatter Plot: Relationship between \'**GDP per capita**\' and \'**Death aged 15-24**\'


```{python}

df_metadata['year'] = pd.to_datetime(df_metadata['year'], errors='coerce').dt.year
latest_year_metadata = df_metadata['year'].max()
latest_metadata = df_metadata[df_metadata['year'] == latest_year_metadata]

year_of_interest = 2000
df_indicator_2['year'] = pd.to_numeric(df_indicator_2['year'], errors='coerce')
df_metadata['year'] = pd.to_numeric(df_metadata['year'], errors='coerce')

# Find the closest year
available_years_indicator = df_indicator_2['year'].unique()
closest_year_indicator = min(available_years_indicator, key=lambda x: abs(x - year_of_interest))

available_years_metadata = df_metadata['year'].unique()
closest_year_metadata = min(available_years_metadata, key=lambda x: abs(x - year_of_interest))

# Filter DataFrames based on the closest years
df_indicator_2_year = df_indicator_2[df_indicator_2['year'] == closest_year_indicator]
df_metadata_year = df_metadata[df_metadata['year'] == closest_year_metadata]

# Aggregate deaths data (summing over sex)
df_indicator_2_year_agg = df_indicator_2_year.groupby('country')['obs_value'].sum().reset_index()

# Merge the two DataFrames on 'country'
merged_data = pd.merge(df_indicator_2_year_agg, df_metadata_year, on='country', how='inner')

plot_scatter_chart(merged_data, 'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)', 'obs_value',
                        f'GDP per Capita vs. Deaths Aged 15-24 (Year {year_of_interest})',
                        'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)', 'Total Deaths Aged 15-24')
```
"In context of the above, let's look at how economic development is related to youth mortality more broadly.  This scatter plot takes into account the connection between **'GDP per capita'** and **'Death aged 15-24'** between nations. This visual allows us to generalize about the impact of economic development on young people's survival and health, but also leads us to consider other variables that could be playing a role."

## 6. Map showing deaths occurred due to poor **SANITATION**





```{python}
sanitation_data_map = df_indicator_1[
        (df_indicator_1['indicator'] == 'Proportion of health care facilities with no sanitation service')
    ]
deaths_data_map = df_indicator_2[
        (df_indicator_2['indicator'] == 'Deaths aged 15 to 24')
    ].groupby('country')['obs_value'].sum().reset_index()

plot_map_sanitation_deaths(sanitation_data_map, deaths_data_map)

```

"Finally, we return full circle to the issue of sanitation, but now we see its ultimate consequence: death.  This interactive map shows deaths resulted from poor SANITATION over the years. This visualization poignantly connects the preceding data on sanitation infrastructure to its dreadful impact on human life, particularly among the vulnerable."


# 7.CONCLUSION:

"The facts we've considered today, show a complex picture.  We've seen improvement in some areas, but also entrenched inequalities and urgent challenges.  Poor sanitation is still a major risk factor, particularly in healthcare facilities and among vulnerable groups.  Economic development plays a part in health outcomes, but it's not the only one.  Gender inequalities and other social determinants have a major impact on health as well."

"These images are not charts and graphs but tools for understanding and action.  They compel us to ask hard questions, to demand more accountability, and to work together to build a healthier, more just world for all."
